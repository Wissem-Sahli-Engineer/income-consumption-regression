# income-consumption-regression
An econometric analysis of the relationship between disposable income and consumption using Simple Linear Regression (OLS) in Python.

## 📊 Overview
The script calculates the regression line using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method and performs various statistical tests to validate the model.

### Key Metrics Calculated:
- **Estimation (MCO):** Calculation of $\hat{a}$ (autonomous consumption) and $\hat{b}$ (Marginal Propensity to Consume).
- **Elasticity:** Calculation of income elasticity at the mean point.
- **Goodness of Fit:** $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$.
- **Inference:**
  - Variance and Standard Error of estimators.
  - Student's t-tests (significance of coefficients).
  - 95% Confidence Intervals.
- **ANOVA:** Analysis of Variance table (F-test).
